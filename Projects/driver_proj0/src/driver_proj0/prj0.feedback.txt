Liam,

- Congratulations on passing the judge Kattis!


However, 

- You are using tabs! You must use two-space indentation.

- The program is missing the header specified in the style guidelines:
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- Line #6 is incorrectly indented.

- The comment in line #5 does not add anything constructive about the function
  of the program. It should be more descriptive or removed. 

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.

- It seems like you are using an IDE, which I strongly advised not to do,
  precisely because it makes several folders, and your source code is hard to
  find. In further project, please only submit your source code in a folder
  called prj/0/ for example, and not your entire set of files and folders
  generated by IDEs. Remember, it is in your best interest that I find your
  work so that I can grade it. Make it easy for me to find it by organizing it
  as I suggested.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
